Problem Description
======================
## Project brief
You have been approached by a client who has a healthy interest in Cryptocurrency. He wants to know how the various coins are performing against US Dollars. His Company is mostly interested in Bitcoin. What his team needs is a dashboard that shows the price of Bitcoin at any point in time without having to refresh the browser. They need the pricing information in realtime because that'd influence their decision whether to buy or sell.

##Advanced Features
